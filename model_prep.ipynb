    "### Overview\n",
    "This document explains how we measure the energy consumption of Python code snippets collected from GitHub. The goal is to identify inefficient code that consumes a lot of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Completed\n",
    "1. **Loading Code Snippets**:\n",
    "   - We load the collected code snippets from `github_code_snippets.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy Measurement Setup**:\n",
    "   - We use the `CodeCarbon` library to measure the energy usage of each snippet.\n",
    "   - The `EmissionsTracker` is used to track emissions while the code executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Executing Code with Tracking**:\n",
    "   - The `run_code_with_energy_tracking` function:\n",
    "     - Starts energy tracking using `EmissionsTracker`.\n",
    "     - Executes the code snippet safely using `exec()`.\n",
    "     - Handles any errors to prevent failures.\n",
    "     - Stops tracking and records the energy usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Storing Results**:\n",
    "   - The measured energy consumption is stored in a new column, `energy_usage`.\n",
    "   - The updated dataset is saved as `code_energy_dataset.csv` for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Ensure the tracking process is efficient and safe.\n",
    "- Implement safeguards to handle long-running or unsafe code.\n",
    "- Analyze the energy dataset to find inefficient patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach helps us measure and understand the energy impact of different code implementations.\n",
    "\n"
